Using transfer learning (fine tuning) with Tensorflow 2 and Keras to compare different CNN architectures


What is Transfer Learning?  
Transfer learning is a method of using pre-trained model which is a saved network that was previously trained on a large dataset.  
There are two types of transfer learning:  
1. Feature Extraction  
2. Fine Tuning  

I will be fine tuning the models on food-11 dataset.  

Requirements:  
TBA  
Works on Tensorflow 2.2!
